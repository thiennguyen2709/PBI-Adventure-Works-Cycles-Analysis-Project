## üìä Key Insights & Visualizations  

### üîç Dashboard Preview  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashhboard 01: Procurement Overview

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e7cceb7-fcfb-40a3-b173-1746cb972ddb)

üìå Insight:
- Purchase order quantity and value increased significantly, especially in 2013 and 2014.
- The average purchase order quantity is approximately 600,000 units.
- The average purchase value is around $16,000,000.
-> This indicates that sales and production have also grown rapidly.

‚úÖ Recommendation:
- Monitor procurement trends to anticipate future demand and ensure supply chain stability.
- Optimize inventory management to avoid overstocking or shortages during high-growth periods.
- Negotiate better contracts with suppliers to accommodate increased purchase volumes and secure cost reductions.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dashhboard 02: Order Fulfillment of Vendors

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b1849cb-2376-4404-a733-83f14b24d915)

üìå Insight:
- Fulfillment rates have significantly improved since 2013, indicating that vendors are more capable of meeting supply demands.
- Some vendors (e.g., SUPERSALES INC.) receive a high number of orders but maintain a low fulfillment rate, which can negatively impact production efficiency and supply chain stability.

‚úÖ Recommendation:
- Diversify supplier base: Instead of relying on vendors with low fulfillment rates, find and onboard additional suppliers with higher reliability.
- Implement vendor performance tracking: Regularly assess supplier fulfillment rates and adjust procurement strategies accordingly.
- Negotiate service-level agreements (SLAs) to ensure better compliance with delivery commitments.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dashhboard 03: Product Quality of Vendors

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a4dcdec-cd4e-45e5-b7c1-2ecc281e279f)

üìå Insight:
Despite the rapid increase in purchase order quantity, defect rates have significantly decreased in 2013 and 2014. This suggests that vendor product quality has improved, and procurement processes (vendor screening, filtering, and evaluation) are more effective.

‚úÖ Recommendation:
- Strengthen partnerships with high-performing vendors who consistently deliver high-quality products.
- Reduce dependency on low-performing vendors with high defect rates while investigating the root causes of quality issues.
- Implement stricter quality control measures before finalizing purchase orders to maintain consistent product standards.
